"Consider a course of systemic corticosteroids for 5-7 days to reduce airway inflammation. Based on the CRP level and risk of infection, initiate antibiotics like levofloxacin. Regularly administer short-acting bronchodilators such as ipratopium for acute symptom relief. Also, include long-acting bronchodilators (LAMA + LABA) for airway management. To maintain SpO2 > 90%, adjust flow rates. Adjust treatment as necessary. Monitoring is crucial. After stabilization, refer to a pulmonary rehabilitation to improve physical stamina and breathing techniques. If applicable, provide resources and support for smoking cessation. Educate about exacerbation management and inhaler techniques."
