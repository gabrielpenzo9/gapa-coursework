Gabriel Penzo – Project Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This repository highlights the projects I’ve built through my Master’s in Health Informatics coursework and personal learning. Each project demonstrates skills in data analysis, health informatics, databases, visualization, and software tools.

Table of Contents

Medication Managament System using mySQL

Tableau Reimbursement Analysis (COVID-19 Relief Funds)

Assessment of the Impact of Drug A on Fasting Sugar Levels

Patient Data Analysis for Improved Healthcare Outcomes

COPD Management CDSS

Medication Management Database (MySQL)

Goal: Build a relational database to manage patient prescriptions, insurance, and pharmacy data, demonstrating how medication management systems can improve care coordination and reduce errors.

Built with: MySQL

Features:

Six core tables: Patient, Prescription, Medication, Doctor, Pharmacy, Insurance
Demonstrated queries for:
Adding, updating, and rolling back patient records
Prescription lookups and dosage updates
Pharmacy contact information via JOINs
Reports on patient age distribution and insurance coverage
Case statements, GROUP BY, HAVING, and indexing

Tableau Reimbursement Analysis (COVID-19 Relief Funds)

Goal:Analyze the distribution of the COVID-19 Provider Relief Fund and the Uninsured Program Claims Reimbursement across U.S. states to understand how relief funds were allocated during the pandemic.

Built with: Tableau (visual dashboards), supporting datasets from HHS and Our World in Data

Features:
Visulizations of testing, treatment, and vaccine reimbursements by state
Analysis of provider-level relief fund distributions in CA, NY, and TX
Comparison between reimbursement categories and vaccination trends

What it shows: 
Skills in data visualization, storytelling with health data, and using federal healthcare datasets
Since the Tableau workbook is too large to upload directly to GitHub, I’ve included a Word document version.
This document contains the full write-up, screenshots, and explanations of the Tableau dashboards created for this project.

Assessment of the Impact of Drug A on Fasting Sugar Levels

Goal: Investigate whether Drug A significantly reduces fasting sugar levels in patients.

Built with: SAS (Statistical Analysis System)

Features:
Analyzed a dataset of 1,000 patients.
Performed statistical tests:
Descriptive statistics (MEANS, UNIVARIATE).
Paired T-test to compare sugar levels before vs. after the drug.
Rejected the null hypothesis (p-value < 0.0001), confirming a significant reduction in fasting sugar levels.

What it shows: Skills in SAS programming, statistical testing, hypothesis validation, and healthcare data analysis.
